Craiglist - Beauty and Health Section Classification


# Our Project Objective

To analyze and refine the beauty and health listings on Craigslist for the New York market, utilizing the region's rich data to enhance categorization and improve the user search experience.


The lack of filters and tags on Craigslist leads to a chaotic Beauty and Health section, mixing various items from weighing scale to trimmers and even coconut milk, leading to a poor search experience.
